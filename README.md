* Car pooling but for bikes. 
* Find people who commute on the same path as you and start riding with them every mornings/evenings
* Making biking in the city safer and convert more people to bike commuting
* Make new friends!

We'd allow users to create new routes and new check-in points (new locations/times) on the map.
